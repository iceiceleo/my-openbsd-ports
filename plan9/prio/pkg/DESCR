This project sprung into life as part of a discussion on how far you could get
in a short-time frame (two hours was the initial limit) mimicking the window
management style of pre-existing WM (Rio from Plan 9 was selected) with some
minimal script re-use for basic input (keymaps / mouse gestures).

It has since been cleaned up and documented somewhat, but it's in what you might
call an 'unpolished state'.

It is intended as a learning tool and an experiment platform in situations where
durden would be a bit too much.
